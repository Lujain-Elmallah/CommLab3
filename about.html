        <p class="about-paragraph">A series of podcast episodes following Sarah throughout her chaotic and creepy life in New York City. Starting with the haunting adventures happening within her apartment where she explores the next door apartment next to her that seems to come to life at night with loud music and laughter. When she goes to check out this life a surprise is waiting for her. The podcast attempts to mix the art of storytelling with sound effects to create an immersive and interactive experience that engages the audience and hooks them to the story. Following the first episode we will be releasing a series of spine chilling stories that will leave thinking about them the entire day. Make sure to visit the website regularly to never miss an episode!</p>
